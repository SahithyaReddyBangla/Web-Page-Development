        <h2>A website is your most powerful tool for communication. A website is a unique way to connect with the world.
             Whether you choose to create a website to share your passion for music, inform people of your business,
             sell products, or any other reason there are no boundaries to what you can do!</h2>
         

        
        <h2>A static website is one that has web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent
             to a client web browser. It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML); Cascading Style 
             Sheets (CSS) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML. Images are commonly used to effect the
              desired appearance and as part of the main content. Audio or video might also be considered "static"
               content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive. 
            This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors. </h2>

        
        <h2>A dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically. 
            Server-side dynamic pages are generated "on the fly" by computer code that produces the HTML 
            (CSS are responsible for appearance and thus, are static files). There are a wide range of 
            software systems, such as CGI, Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP), Active Server Pages
             and ColdFusion (CFML) that are available to generate dynamic web systems and dynamic sites.
